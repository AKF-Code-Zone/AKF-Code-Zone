##  About Me

I'm a 5th semester Computer Science student passionate about turning ideas into clean, interactive web interfaces.

With every line of HTML and CSS I write, I aim for both structure and style — and I’m now focused on leveling up with JavaScript and Cloud (AWS). I believe good frontend isn’t just about code — it’s about experience, clarity, and beauty.

I'm organized, committed, and love bringing personality into my projects — whether it's a game, a brand simulation, or a full interface.
